      <h2>1. Orthophoto — Accurate, Measurable Property Map</h2>
      <p>
        The orthophoto provides a distortion-free, top-down map of the entire property. This allows
        homeowners to measure distances, plan improvements, and document their land with precision.
      </p>

      <h3>Homeowner Benefits</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Measure patios, fences, driveways, and landscaping accurately.</li>
        <li>Document roof and yard conditions for insurance or resale.</li>
        <li>Understand property boundaries visually.</li>

  <!-- NDVI -->
  <div class="service-grid">
    <div class="service-card">
      <h2>2. NDVI — Vegetation Health Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        NDVI reveals the true health of grass, trees, and landscaping by analyzing how vegetation
        reflects near-infrared light. This exposes stress long before it becomes visible.
      </p>

      <h3>Homeowner Benefits</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Detect irrigation issues early.</li>
        <li>Identify stressed or diseased areas of lawn or trees.</li>
        <li>Protect expensive landscaping investments.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="service-card">
      <h2>3. Surface Model — Elevation, Slope & Drainage</h2>
      <p>
        The surface model shows how the land slopes and where water naturally flows or pools. This is
        essential for preventing drainage issues and planning improvements.
      </p>

      <h3>Homeowner Benefits</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify low spots where water collects.</li>
        <li>Plan patios, driveways, and landscaping with slope in mind.</li>
