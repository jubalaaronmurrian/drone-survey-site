      <h2>What is an Orthophoto?</h2>
      <p>
        An orthophoto is a drone image that has been corrected for tilt and perspective so every point is at a consistent scale.
        Unlike a normal aerial photo, you can measure distances and areas directly on the image.
      </p>

      <h2>Why it matters to homeowners</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Plan improvements:</strong> Measure decks, driveways, fences, and landscaping before you build.</li>
        <li><strong>Document your property:</strong> Keep a visual record of your roof, yard, and structures for insurance or resale.</li>
        <li><strong>See the whole picture:</strong> Understand how your home, yard, and neighboring lots relate in one clear view.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Typical deliverables</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>High-resolution orthophoto (GeoTIFF and web-friendly image)</li>
        <li>Measurement overlays (areas, distances, annotations)</li>
        <li>Optional web viewer for interactive zoom and pan</li>
      </ul>
