    <h1>NDVI Vegetation Health for Your Yard</h1>
    <p>
      A data-driven look at how healthy your grass, trees, and landscaping really are—beyond what the eye can see.

      <h2>What is NDVI?</h2>
      <p>
        NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) uses near-infrared and visible light to measure how “alive” vegetation is.
        Healthy plants reflect light differently than stressed or dying plants, and NDVI turns that into a clear map.
      </p>

      <h2>Why it matters to homeowners</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Find hidden stress:</strong> Spot areas where grass or trees are struggling before they visibly brown out.</li>
        <li><strong>Optimize irrigation:</strong> See where you’re over-watering or under-watering and adjust sprinklers accordingly.</li>
        <li><strong>Protect landscaping investments:</strong> Catch issues early on expensive trees, hedges, or garden beds.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Typical deliverables</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Colorized NDVI map (red/yellow/green for vegetation health)</li>
        <li>Side-by-side NDVI and regular aerial imagery</li>
        <li>Summary report highlighting problem zones and recommendations</li>
      </ul>

        <h3>Suggested chart: Health distribution</h3>
        <p>
          Pie chart or stacked bar showing percentage of lawn/landscaping in “Healthy”, “Moderate”, and “Stressed” categories.
        </p>
        <div class="service-image-placeholder">
          Example: Pie chart with 60% Healthy (green), 25% Moderate (yellow), 15% Stressed (red).

          Example: Same yard shown twice—NDVI clearly highlights a stressed patch the eye barely notices.
