    <h1>Surface & Elevation Models for Your Property</h1>
    <p>
      Understand how water flows, where low spots are, and how your land really slopes—before you build or regrade.

      <h2>What are surface and elevation models?</h2>
      <p>
        A surface model is a 3D representation of your property, including ground, structures, and vegetation.
        From this, we can generate elevation maps, contour lines, and slope analysis.
      </p>

      <h2>Why it matters to homeowners</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Drainage and flooding:</strong> See where water naturally collects and flows during heavy rain.</li>
        <li><strong>Plan grading and hardscapes:</strong> Design patios, driveways, and retaining walls with the slope in mind.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid costly surprises:</strong> Identify low spots, steep areas, or problematic slopes before construction.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Typical deliverables</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Elevation heatmap of your property</li>
        <li>Contour lines overlaid on an orthophoto</li>
        <li>3D visualization or point cloud (for advanced planning)</li>
      </ul>
